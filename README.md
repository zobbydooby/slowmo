Slowmo

A simple programme intended to take a 5 second clip, then replay it in slow
motion.

Note:
This was developed for the Raspberry pi PiCamera application and utilises
'MP4Box' to convert the output file from h264 to mp4. 

Due to it utilising unix shell commands, realistically it will only function
on Linux or similar operating systems.

The programme loops infinately and must be manually halted.
